## Introduction

Hello everyone! Today, we are here to present our project for the NASA Space App Challenge. Our team, consisting of 2 boys and 2 girls, has worked in the challenge `Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects` and we are excited to share our work with you.

## Orrery Web App - [Live Demo](https://astron.vercel.app/)

Our orrery web app is a visually stunning representation of the solar system. It allows users to explore and interact with the celestial bodies in a 3D environment. With the help of Three.js and React-Three-Fiber, we were able to create a seamless and immersive experience.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: We chose Next.js for its server-side rendering capabilities and easy integration with React.
- TypeScript: By using TypeScript, we ensured type safety and improved the overall maintainability of our codebase.
- Three.js: Three.js provided us with the necessary tools to render 3D graphics in the browser.
- React-Three-Fiber: This library allowed us to combine the power of React with Three.js, making it easier to manage and update our 3D scene.
- Kysely: Kysely helped us build a robust and efficient database layer for our app.
- Postgres: We utilized Postgres as our database management system to store and retrieve data.
- Prisma: Prisma acted as our ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, simplifying database operations and enhancing productivity.

## Thank You!

We would like to express our gratitude to the NASA Space Apps Challenge organizers for giving us the opportunity to participate in this event. We had a great time working on our project and learned a lot in the process. We look forward to future challenges and hope to continue exploring the wonders of space together.

Also, we would like to thanks 42 Malaga for all the opportunities and support they give us to grow as developers.
